# 3.5 to Roll20
Right now takes in XML file from http://www.andargor.com/ (Huge thanks for publishing this) and spits out a pretty generic SRD-looking spell macro! Nicer than nothing :)

## Usage
To run this software, just use the executable located in 3.5 to Roll20\bin\Debug!

### Future improvements:
--------------------
* Autocomplete
* Rethink the buttons - why not always copy to clipboard?
* Class filtrering
* Spell level filtering
* Choose between different templates
* Construct a damage macro with some easy inputs.


### Future improvements that I probably won't do
---------------------------------------------
* Parse DC of spell resistance for roll20 from character variable
* Parse proper range based on class level
* Any other parsing ideas from roll20 variables!

Because my party doesn't use the built in sheets we don't have variables so tough to get motivated for this :)
